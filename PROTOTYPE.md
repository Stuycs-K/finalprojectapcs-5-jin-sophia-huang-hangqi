Metrominoes \
Brief Project description (1 paragraph summary)\
Based on Tetris. Drop tetrominoes that fall faster and faster as the levels go up. There are 7 tetrominoes (I, O, T, S, Z, L, J), and we use keys to rotate them and move them around. Fill a row to clear the row. You get more points for stuff like tetris (clearing four rows at once) or T-spins or combos. This will attempt to completely replicate the original Tetris game.\

Expanded Description:\
Critical features (Minimum Viable Product) - What you want to have after 1.5 weeks.\
- Cancel out row once complete; keep track using array/or rows represented by Deque (?)
- block should fall down but pause before settling
- key controls for rotation of blocks
- key controls for moving left/right and dropping
- randomized block generation

Nice to have features - What you would want to have by the end
- Tetris music!!! + settings to turn off music/sfx
- block falling speeds up as you increase "levels" by clearing some number of lines
- queue of 3 tetrominoes that will come next
- “hold” function — can keep track of one block but can only switch between the falling and “held” block once
- high score, home page for restarting
