How you will be using the topics covered in class in the project.


**PERIOD:** 5\
**Groupt Members:** Sophia Jin and Hangqi Huang\
**Group Name:** Metrominoes \
**Brief Project description (1 paragraph summary):**\
We're are making a game of Tetris. In Tetris, tetrominoes are dropped and they fall faster and faster as the time goes on. There are 7 tetrominoes (I, O, T, S, Z, L, J), and we use keys to rotate them and move them around. Fill a row to clear the row. You get more points for feats like tetris (clearing four rows at once) or T-spins or combos. This will attempt to completely replicate the original Tetris game.\
**Expanded Description:**\
Critical Features (Minimum Viable Product):
- Representation of grid using array or Deque
- Randomized block generation
- block should fall down but pause before settling
- Cancel out row once complete
- key controls for rotation of blocks
- key controls for moving left/right and dropping

Nice to have features:
- Tetris music!!! + settings to turn off music/sfx
- block falling speeds up as you increase "levels" by clearing some number of lines
- queue of the 3 tetrominoes that will come next
- “hold” function — can keep track of one block but can only switch between the falling and “held” block once
- high score, home page for restarting
