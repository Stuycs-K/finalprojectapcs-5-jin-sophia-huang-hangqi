# Project Description

A Processing imitation of the popular game Tetris.

# Intended usage:
In this game, one of the seven tetrominoes will drop from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen in the center (randomly generated). The game is over when no new blocks can be dropped and the goal of the game is to keep the game going for as long as possible. Rows can be cancelled when the whole row is filled with blocks. Use the DOWN arrow to move the block down one block, but note that the blocks will naturally fall. Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow to move the block left and right, respectively. Use the UP arrow to rotate the block clockwise. Use the Z key to rotate the block counterclockwise. Use the SPACE bar to automatically drop the block to the lowest possible possition.
