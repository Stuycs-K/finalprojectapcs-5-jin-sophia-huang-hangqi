### 2025-05-22 - Started the Tetris class
Spent the whole in class period testing with different dimensions of screen and boxes. Still need to find a way to intergrate Box class and Tetris.

### 2025-05-22 - Integrated Box[][] with grid
A Box[][] was declared and initialized as grid. grid was then filled up with Boxes of color(0), or black. The grid was then drawn according to the color inside each box. Total of half an hour spent.

### 2025-05-23 - Separated grid and Tetris
To make things more convenient, I moved Grid.class out from Tetris.class. Need to work on random generation of blocks and fall.
